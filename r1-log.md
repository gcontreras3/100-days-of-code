### R1D1 
Started a Weather App. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with OpenWeather API http://www.example.com

### R1D2

Today's Progress: Spent more time working on my SearchBar App, I was able to grab the users input, next I will learn how to display that onto a list, preferably an ordered list. This project has a lot of buiding components in which I broke down into small steps, I am completing the steps in order because I have found that I am jumping from one component to another without actually solving the issue.

Thoughts: Today was a pain but with practice comes perfection.

### R1D3

Today's Progress: Today I tried to figure out how to add a name to the contact list but I was unable to figure how to do that, instead I skipped this section and added a filter function. I decided to add it since I knew how I could filter the results. Without the component to add names to the list, I have a filter function that does not work properly.

Thoughts: I've decided that I need to study on this feature more, I really want to get it down so I can complete the project.

### R1D4

Today's Progress: Today I continued working on the SearchBar App, I was able to get input to show but I am unable to get it to stick on the page, I need this to save onto local storage in order to keep record of the contacts. I also am going to pair program with a coworker tomorrow to figure out the issue.

On another note: I started learning Java programming and am going to start building my projects with it.

Thoughts: Excited to learn Java

### R1D5

Today's Progress: Today I pair programmed with someone to help with the project since I have been stuck on getting user input to display on the page.
I learned more Java, learned about shortcuts to running a program. I learned what classes were that most Java programs consist of.

Thoughts: I am really enjoying Java in a nutshell.
